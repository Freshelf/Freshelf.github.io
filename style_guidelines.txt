Overall Look and Feel of Freshelf
================================

The overall look and feel is simple but layered. It should give a sense of depth, in the same fashion the Freshelf product is basic and deep.
There is also a cozy feel, with the simple wooden backgrounds in the header and the navigation bar.

Colours
=========
We tried using colors that are relaxing to the user and that revolve around a green theme.
There are the colors we used : 
- #65c35c
- #44312d
- #f2ebd9
- #3f443d

Typography
===========
We'll be using Fira from google font and the demo of a font called Stepped.

Links
======
Links are not underlined, and have a variety of looks. There are no links to external sources however; only to scroll to anchors on
the one page, as well as to open pop-up 'windows'.

Buttons
========
As mentioned in the overall look and feel section, the buttons in the navigation bar and the header will have wooden textures.
The buttons in the sections themselves will have the same look as their respective section, but 3D to symbolize
that pressing them will open a pop-up window independant of the rest of the page.
